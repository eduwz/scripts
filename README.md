<i>some ahk scripts</i>

you will need AutoHotKey https://www.autohotkey.com/
everything after a semicolon ";" is a comment and will be ignored when the script runs.

To run the script when windows starts create a shortcut of the script then throw it on the windows Startup folder.<br>
windows key + R, type "shell:startup" then press enter.<br>

<h20>or C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup


I personally don't like to have multiple scripts open, so I usually make a "cfg" with the most used daily scripts, which is basically a bunch of scripts on one file(will post later).


for PoE i also use this
